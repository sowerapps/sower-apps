To build on Linux install wxWidgets, libbz2, SFML, and Code::Blocks. Open 'sowerapps.workspace' with Code::Blocks, select a target 'debug_linux' or 'release_linux' and then 'Build workspace' on the Build menu.

To build on MSW create a folder named 'depends-msw' in the Sower Applications folder. You will need to place libbz2, SFML, and wxWidgets in this folder and build them. The folders should be named 'libbz2', 'SFML', and 'wxwidgets'. If libbz2.a resides in it's root folder place it in a folder named 'lib'. When built wxWidgets typically places the lib's in a subfolder of the lib folder. You will need to move these into the lib folder.

Resources (such as images for buttons) that SowerBase relies on are in the 'resource' directory, this folder can be copied to the default location where SowerBase expects to find it, which is depends on the operating system. Click 'Configuration' on the Help menu of Sower, or ThML Viewer to find see where SowerBase expects resources to be. SowerBase can be configured to find it somewhere else. Refer to Sower Help for more information on this.
