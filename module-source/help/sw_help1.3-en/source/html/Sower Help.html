    <p>Sower applications are designed to be cross-platform, and so
      a cross-platform solution for application help files was needed. The solution is Sower Help, which is a Sower application that loads only
      Sower modules with a category setting of 'Help'. Help modules are built from ThML files like all other other Sower modules,
      and have the same capabilities as other modules (such as streaming media, and AutoDef functionality).</p>
