  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Sower, and ThML Viewer are very similar applications. The primary
      difference is that Sower is designed to use Sower Modules for primary
      content while ThML Viewer uses ThML files. Both rely on Sower Modules, and
      ThML files for AutoDef data. Both are also designed so that the user
      interface is created through plug-ins. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma
      interface plug-ins are available for both programs, and each provides
      access to the available content in a different way so that users can
      choose the interface that is most comfortable for them. Below is some
      basic information on the user interfaces.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>AutoDef windows are pop-up windows that appear when a link has been
        clicked, or the mouse has been moved over a reference that the
        application recognizes, or a word that an entry can be found for in a
        dictionary etc. Moving the mouse into the AutoDef window will cause it
        to stay visible. The window can be scrolled to view content, if the
        contents are not copy protected it can be selected and copied, or
        printed. And AutoDef windows can have AutoDef windows. It may take
        practice to work with AutoDef windows, the advantage is automatic
        retrieval of information, and the ability to follow a stream of
        information up to the point where there is insufficient space for a
        window within a window. AutoDef can also use GeoLocation, or embedded
        map data to find relevant information for locations when moving the
        mouse within an image of a map.</li>
      <li>Modules, and ThML files that AutoDef is allowed to retrieve can be
        enabled\disabled through the Preferences dialog.</li>
      <li>When creating a bookmark selecting a section of text will the
        selection to be selected when the bookmark is activated later.</li>
      <li>Once a bookmark has been created a note can be added, or edited with a
        left click on the item in the BookMarks panel.</li>
      <li>Right click on a bookmark will pull up a menu that allows the bookmark
        to be deleted.</li>
      <li>Use the Preferences dialog to:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Set the location of libraries.</li>
          <li>Default font size for content viewers, and AutoDef windows.</li>
          <li>Select the user interface.</li>
          <li>Select the theme.</li>
          <li>Select the language.</li>
          <li>Enable\disable saving the session at upon closing the application.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Alpha interface is a tabbed interface. The tab control can be
        split by dragging a tab to a different position in the window. Once a
        tab control has been split other tabs can be dragged onto any of the new
        tab controls. There can be any number of tab controls split off in this
        manner allowing the user to have multiple books viewable at the same
        time, and allowing the tab controls to be organized, and sized to the
        preferences of the user.</li>
      <li>The Beta interface provides a single table of contents for all
        available content, and all content is displayed in the same window.</li>
      <li>The Gamma interface is a tabbed interface in which content is divided
        into categories with a separate tab, and table of contents for each.</li>
      <li>Sower is intended to provide content from Sower Modules. But, Sower
        can also display ThML files which when opened will be displayed in a
        separate tab control. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Note: </p>
    <p>ThML files exist in two forms. In one form it is split into multiple
      files, while in the other form everything exists in one large file (with
      the exception of any external media). ThML Viewer is designed to work with
      ThML files in the second form only. </p>
