    <p>Sower Librarian is a tool designed to create, and maintain a library of
      Sower Modules built from ThML files. It scans the selected folder, and
      sub-folders searching for ThML files, and corresponding modules. It
      compares file dates and skips any that appear to be current. If a module
      has been built before there should be a card file for the module. If there
      is a card file and the module needs to be rebuilt it is done without
      requiring any user interaction. This minimizes the need for user input
      when updating an existing library. A password can be entered for any
      modules that require encryption. The same password will be used for all
      encrypted modules. If a modules requires encryption and a password has not
      been entered the module will be skipped. It is similar in operation to
      Sower Module Writer, and creates the same files with the exception that it
      creates one log file for all modules in the root folder of the library
      instead of a log file for each module.</p>
   <p>Encryption is only available if the encryption plug-in is available. At
      this point in time that plug-in has not been released.</p>
