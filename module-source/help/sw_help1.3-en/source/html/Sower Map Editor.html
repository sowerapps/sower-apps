    <p>Sower Map Editor is a utility for creating Image Maps (a list of points
      on an image) which can be included in Sower Modules, and related to a
      specific image. It does not edit the image itself.</p>
    <p>The items (map areas) in the image map specify the position of a point on
      the image, name, draw color, fill color, and radius. AutoDef uses the name
      to locate information related to the area to display in an AutoDef window.
      If a translation file is available the name of the area can be translated
      and displayed in a tooltip window, or used to find information for AutoDef
      in a different language.</p>
    <p>Image Maps can be automatically generated with user input for approximate
      pixels positions of latitude, and longitude of&nbsp; 4 positions on the
      map image. These are top, bottom, left, and right. And do not have to be
      the absolute corners, but as close as possible for greatest accuracy. The
      generated map areas can be edited manually if needed. Image Maps are
      stored in an Image Map List, allowing multiple Image Maps for the image to
      be stored in one Sower Binary Object. </p>
