    <p>Sower Theme Editor is used to create, and edit themes for
      Sower software. A theme is simply a list of images to be used for gui
      element of the user interface, and each image is associated with a string
      identifier. The theme file is named 'themes.sdf' which can be found in the
      software's data directory + 'themes'. For MS Windows this will be the
      directory where the application resides. Images should be in the png
      format, and 16X16 pixels. To create a new theme first create a sub-folder
      in Sower's theme directory, place the images for the theme in that folder.
      Then start Theme Editor, open 'themes.sdf', add a new table with the name
      of the new theme. Select the new table, and click 'Load'. Once the new
      table is loaded right click on any identifier in the list at the top of
      application frame to set the image for that identifier.</p>

    <p>To add a new theme table enter a name in the box provided, and click
      'Add'. Click 'Load' to open the new table for editing.</p>

      String identifiers can only be added, or deleted when no tables are
      loaded. String identifiers when added are added to all tables, and when
      deleted are deleted from all tables.</p>

      new identifier.</p>
