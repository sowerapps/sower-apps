    <p>Sower Data File Editor is used to edit Sower's table based data files
      (sdf), and is similar to Sower Theme Editor, and Sower Translation Editor.
      It is designed for general use and allows more direct editing of the data
      in those files, and does not require that each table have the same list of
      identifiers.</p>
    <p>To edit a file first open it with the 'Open' command on the 'File' menu.
    </p>
    <p>Table Editor will show a list of the&nbsp; tables available in the file.</p>
    <p><b>Table Panel:</b></p>
    <p> Select a table, and click 'Load' to open that table for editing. Click
      'Save' to save changes to the table before clicking 'Close' which will
      close the loaded table without saving any changes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To add a new table enter a name in the box provided, and click 'Add'.
      Click 'Load' to open the new table for editing.</p>
    <p>Clicking 'Delete' will delete any selected table.</p>
    <p>Values are edited by clicking the item in the list at the of the
      application frame. </p>
    <p><b>Identifiers Panel:</b><br>
      String identifiers can only be added, or deleted when a table is loaded.
      And are only added to the loaded table.</p>

      identifier.</p>
    <p>Clicking 'Delete' will delete any selected identifier from the loaded
      table.</p>
