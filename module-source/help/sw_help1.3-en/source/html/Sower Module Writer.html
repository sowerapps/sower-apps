  <body>
    <p> Sower Module Writer creates modules from ThML files.</p>
    <p>Steps to module creation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select the source file.</li>
      <li>Select the destination file.</li>
      <li>Enter the title of the book, and an abbreviation to be used to
        represent the book.</li>
      <li>Enter an identifier for the book. This should be something such as a
        ISBN number if available. It must be unique.</li>
      <li>Select the category that best fits the book.</li>
      <li>Enter any group that applies to the book. Such as a particular author.</li>
      <li>And if applicable enter the versification scheme used by the book,
        such as 'KJV'.</li>
      <li>Enter the original file name of the source file in the box provided.
        This maybe used to follow links between books. Enter only the file name,
        do not include the file path.</li>
      <li>Sower Modules can be encrypted. If the encryption plug-in is available
        the 'Encrypt' box will be enabled which can be checked and will enable a
        password to be entered. The module will be encrypted, and a master key
        will be created and stored in Sower's data folder
        (data-dir\keys\master). Copy commands to content viewers that are
        displaying any content of this module can be disabled by unchecking the
        box labeled 'Allow Copy'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click 'Build'.</p>
    <p>Five files will be created the module (.smd), a bzipped file containing
      the compressed module (.bz2), a catalog card that contains information for
      the module so that it doesn't have to be entered again if the module is
      rebuilt (.card), and an html file which displays the full title of the
      module in that folder (Title.html). It is best for&nbsp; ThML files to be
      stored in it's own folder. A log file containing containing the results of
      the build process (.log.txt).</p>
    <p>During the build process error messages may be displayed. For most error
      messages the portion of the text in the source file that caused the error
      will follow the error code so that the problem can be located in the
      source file.</p>
