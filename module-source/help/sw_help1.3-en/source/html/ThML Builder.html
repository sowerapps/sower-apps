    <p>ThML Builder is a utility designed to create a ThML file from multiple
      html files. The resulting file may require further editing. It is intended
      to reduce some of the work required to convert a multi-file html book to
      ThML.</p>
    <p>To create a ThML file:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter any information that should be stored in the dublin core of the
        file.</li>
      <li>Click the 'Select files' button to select the files to be used in the
        build.</li>
      <li>Select or enter the 'Save as' file path.</li>
      <li>Uncheck any files in the list that should not be included in the
        build.</li>
      <li>Use the 'Up', and 'Down' buttons to position the files according to
        the desired contents of the resulting ThML file.</li>
      <li>Click 'Build'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ThML Builder can also load a Sower Project file which describes how to
      build the ThML file. This method allows for the creation of more complex
      books. And also provides options for automatic markup of scripture
      references.</p>
