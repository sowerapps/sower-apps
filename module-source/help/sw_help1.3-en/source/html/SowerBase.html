    <p>SowerBase is a cross-platform dynamic link library, or shared object
      designed to provide the foundation code for Sower applications. Some of it's
      capabilities are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Handles theme, translation, bookmark, and preferences files for
        applications.</li>
      <li>Provides facilities for working with Html, and ThML.</li>
      <li>Recognizes scripture references in multiple languages, and forms.</li>
      <li>GeoLocation data for working with maps of the ancient world.</li>
      <li>Provides a very versatile book module design, and the facilities to
        work with those modules.</li>
      <li>Provides a gui frame work on top of the wxWidgets frame work, reducing
        much of the work involved in handling windows, menus, and toolbars.
        Including specialized controls designed to work with Sower modules, ThML
        files, and automatically update themselves for language, or theme
        changes.</li>
      <li>Plug-In, and module managers.</li>
      <li>Initialization of applications, and SowerBase itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And more. Greatly reducing the complexity of writing document driven
      software that works with ThML files, or Sower modules.</p>
